ECE/CPSC 8830: Blockchain & Web3
Team Project – Full-Stack Web3 dApp Development and 
Deployment
Due Date: 11/21/2025
Team Size: 2–3 students
Submission: Upload (1) GitHub repository link, (2) Vercel demo URL, and (3) 
team_project_report.pdf to Canvas.
I. Background
This team project expands Assignment 2. Instead of deploying a single contract only, you will now build a 
complete Web3 decentralized application (dApp) that includes both:
1) A verified Solidity smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet, and
2) A React frontend that interacts with that contract through ethers.js, hosted publicly on Vercel.
II. Project Topic
Each team chooses your own application theme (e.g., crowdfunding, escrow, NFT minting, token 
rewards, time-locked wallet, proposal system, etc.). The project must not reuse or duplicate the Voting 
Contract from Assignment 2.
Every project must meet the technical requirements in Section III to be eligible for grading.
III. Functional Requirements (Minimum Viable dApp)
1. Smart Contract (Backend)
§ Language: Solidity ^0.8.x
§ Network: Sepolia Testnet
§ Verification: Required on Etherscan (Sepolia)
§ Must contain all of the following elements:
Requirement Details
State-Changing 
Functions (≥ 2)
At least two functions that modify the blockchain state (e.g., 
create, deposit, withdraw, register, approve). At least one may 
be payable.
View Functions (≥ 1) At least one function that reads and returns data without 
changing state.
Events (≥ 1)
Emit at least one event when a state-changing action occurs (for 
example event Action(address user, uint 
value);).
Security and 
Validation
Use require() statements to validate inputs and conditions. 
Include at least one access-control mechanism (onlyOwner, 
creator-only, whitelist, or signature check).
Deployment and 
Verification
Deploy the final version to Sepolia and verify the exact source 
code on Etherscan with matching compiler version and 
optimization settings.
2. Frontend (User Interface)
§ Framework: React (Vite template)
§ Library for Blockchain Access: ethers.js
§ Wallet Integration: MetaMask
§ Hosting Platform: Vercel (Required)
Your frontend must demonstrate the following functions:
Function Description
Connect Wallet Button to connect MetaMask and display the current wallet address and 
network (Sepolia).
Write Operation At least one button or form that calls a state-changing contract function 
(transaction). Display a message for pending, success, or failure.
Read Operation At least one button to call a view function and display on-chain data 
(e.g., total funds, number of participants, latest message).
Event or Result 
Display
Show event logs or transaction results after execution.
Online 
Deployment
Entire frontend must be publicly available on Vercel with a 
working .vercel.app URL.
IV. Unified Environment
Component Specification
Network Sepolia Testnet (only)
Wallet MetaMask
Compiler Solidity ^0.8.x
Frontend React (Vite) + ethers.js
Hosting Vercel (Required)
V. Recommended Workflow
1) Plan and Design – define application logic, state variables, functions, and events.
2) Implement Contract – develop and test in Remix; verify security checks.
3) Deploy to Sepolia – record the contract address and verify on Etherscan.
4) Integrate Frontend – use ethers.js to connect MetaMask and call contract functions.
5) Deploy Frontend to Vercel – push to GitHub à import into Vercel à obtain .vercel.app URL.
6) Test and Document – perform one successful transaction and one intentional failure (require 
rejection), take screenshots, and record links for the report.
VI. Testing and Verification (Evidence Required)
The report must include screenshots or links for:
1) Verified contract page on Etherscan (Sepolia).
2) At least one successful transaction and its event log.
3) At least one failed transaction showing a require error.
4) Working frontend page with wallet connection, write/read functions, and event display.
5) Accessible Vercel URL (.vercel.app) demonstrating the complete dApp.
VII. Report Guidelines (2–3 pages)
File name: team_project_report.pdf
Include the following sections in order:
1) Team members and individual roles (one line per member).
2) System Design Overview (state variables, functions, events, access control).
3) Deployment Evidence (contract address, Etherscan link, transaction hashes).
4) Frontend Demo (Vercel link + screenshots of wallet connection and interactions).
5) Testing Results (one successful case and one failed case with short explanations).
6) Gas Usage or Security Note (one paragraph; choose either topic).
7) Lessons Learned (5~8 sentences on team experience and future improvements).
VIII. Grading and Evaluation (Simple Structure)
Criterion Description Points
Functional dApp
Contract and frontend work together; wallet connects, 
transaction succeeds, state reads correctly, event visible 
on both frontend and Etherscan.
